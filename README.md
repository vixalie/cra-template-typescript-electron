# cra-template-typescript-electron

This is a create-react-app (CRA) template that uses Typescript completely for Electron applications based on the [official TypeScript template for Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/cra-template-typescript).

Applications created by this template make wverything works with Typescript. By default, React App as the renderer is located in `src` directory, and the main world is located in `src-main` directory. Due to changes build target, the React App may not run properly in browsers, you should develop your applications in Electron.
